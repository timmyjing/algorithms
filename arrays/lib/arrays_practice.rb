#Single Element in a Sorted Array
#Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. 
#Find this single element that appears only once. Do it in O(logn) time and O(1) space!

#Things you should be thinking of
#O(logn) should immediately make you think of Binary Search.
#What condition are we checking for?
#How do we know which direction to go next?
